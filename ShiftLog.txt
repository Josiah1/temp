Flight CA1497 in the morning. Arriving in jinping at about 5:00 afternoon. 
Dealing with affairs and network-things in the evening.
2017.06.26:
I entered the experimental cave at 8:00. Then I stopped run 132 and started 
a new physical run 133 at about 9:25. Trying to be familiar with the posters. 
Then got out of the cave at about 10:30.
Trying to summary the shift handbook in the afternoon.
2017.06.27:
Morning about 9:48, I login Xshell in my computer, and then stopped run 
133 and started a new physical run 134. The shell print: 
" The trigger time of board 3 if different than that of board0 by 
-2.28765e+07 ns.  Press ``Enter'' key to exit''  "
Then I press Enter key and start a new physical run 135.
2017.06.28:
In the morning, about 10:15, I stop the run 135 and then start a run 136. 
In the afternoon, I enter the experimental cave to measure the radius of 
pipes deployed on the water purifier.
2017.06.29:
In the morning, about 11:15, I stop the run 136 and then start a run 137. 
2017.06.30:
In the morning, about 11:30, I stop the run 137 and then start a run 138. 
2017.07.01:
Online access has been totally down. I thought I couldn't login online 
server, so I didn't start a new run.
2017.07.02:
Net connection hasn't been recovered. I stop run 138 and start a new run 
139.
2017.07.03:
I stop run 139 and start a new run 140 in the afternoon about 18:40.
2017.07.04:
I stop run 140 and start a new run 141 in the afternoon about 16:40.
2017.07.05:
I stop run 141 and start a new run 142.
2017.07.06:
I stopped run 142. Then Open the water cycle of water purifier for outer 
tank. And start a new run 143 at last.
2017.07.07:
I stop the run 143 and start a new run 144. Water resistivity has been

out of power for 10 minutes. So the water purifier has stop working. And 
I open it again in the afternoon.
2017.07.12:

Start a new physics run 168.
In the afternoon we examine concentration solutions and get though all 
calculations again. Do preparation of LS replacement.

2017-07-28
Stop run 168
Before any LS-water pumping operation
Outer water level 20.45 cm
Inter vessel level 20.75 cm

10:08 Start to pump out water
  10:17 Inter vessel level 57.61 cm
  11:20 Leave for lunch at level 70 cm

13:00 Start pump out water and liquid scintillator 1st tank in
  First tank: 162.2 kg of LAB
  Water pump runs at 30% of full rate, LS running at 20% of the full rate
  13:17, level 80 cm, then LS pump change to 30% of the full rate
  13:50, 1/3 of a barrel is finished
  14:03, level 84 cm. Increase LS pump to 40% of the full rate 
  14:35, level 80 cm, 2/3 of a tank of LS is inside
  15:02, roughly 1 of LS tank is pumped in.
  Next always try to control liquid level at 75-80 cm by adjusting two 
pumps and valves.
  Dirty thing found at the bottom of tank one, inside of the bag
 - LS (LAB+PPO+Bis-MSB) left from Tank 1 is about 0.5 liter

15:40 Second tank of LS starts pumping
  2nd tank: 174.8 kg of LAB
17:05 Inner sphere liquid level 73 cm
17:15 Stop all pumping and turn off all volves
  
2017-07-29
  8:33 Inner sphere level 73 cm, Restore pumping tank 2 LS
  8:42 Finished the 2nd tank

8:45 Start 3rd tank of LS
  3rd tank: 143.2 kg of LAB
  9:12 while preparing 4th tank of LS, may loss concentration solution 
10 mL
  10:24 Finish 3rd tank
  At 60% rate of LS pump, the flow rate is 172.5316L/99 min = 1.743 L/min
  To add 30 L of LAB (since 1200 L is not enough), we need pump it for 
17.2 min.

10:30 Pump in pure LAB for 17.2 min, about 30 L from tank 7 (total 169.3 
kg of LAB in tank 7)

10:50 Start to pump the 4th tank of LS
  4th tank: 170.5 kg of LAB
  11:20 Leave for lunch
  12:45 Restart of tank 4
  14:08 Finished tank 4
  About ((170.5/0.86)+7.19)/(30+15+60+08)=1.8181 L/min

14:11 Pump in pure LAB for 16.5 min, about 30 L from tank 7

14:30 Start pump tank 5
  5th tank: 171.4 kg of LAB
  16:30 Finished tank 5
  We have stopped pumping water out but let it flow naturally.
  Now the inner vessel level is 69.53 cm
  Checking outer water level now: 20.50 cm, which is different by 
20.50-25.45=0.05 cm=0.5 mm from the beginning. Great, no leaking to outer 
vessel.

16:?? Start pump tank 6
  6th tank: 168.6 kg of LAB
  17:16 at 50-60 cm inner vessel liquid level changes very fast, must in 
neck
  17:16 Stop all pumping and turn off all valves, inner liquid level 51.10 
cm

2017-07-30
8:30 Inner liquid level 50.07 cm
  Since inner sphere is almost full, start pump our water for a while
  At 8:58 The first sign of LS was seen at the outlet observing barrel
  9:00 Pump LS from tank 6 again
One valve is closed during pumping, causing a pipe and a connector broken 
and serious leaking. 10:27 fixed pipe and connector. Next time, need an 
outlet pressure gauge.
  10:27: Inner liquid level 64 cm
  10:40: 57.99 cm, release air pressure for a second
  10:46 LS reach overflow tank. Around 21 cm - 22 cm level change slowly 
now.
  11:17 LS reach 17.25 cm. Stopped. Leave for lunch

14:04 Inner vessel stabilized at 15.80 cm
14:09 Start a new test run to check time information
  Run 169. Quit too fast (Physics run, NHit>=4, 170 Hz, 27Mb/s). 
  Pedestal run 170 first
  Run 171 Physics run (NHit>=4, 169 Hz, 29 Mb/s, quit by itself.)
  Scan NHit threshold for a workable trigger rate
  NHit>=22 can Trigger rate 111 Hz 27 Mb/s
  Start Run 192 (with NHit>=25)

Fixed trigger time "Sec" output bug for Readout program
Added log file output for Readout program

17:10 Start physics run 209 with NHit>=25. (Trigger rate 63 Hz, 15 Mbytes/s)
20:21 Find a bug in file name. Fixed.
Start run physics 213 with NHit>=27 (Trigger rate 31, file 7.6 Mbytes/s)
Change the readout size to 1024 bytes to enhance writing rate
21:02 Start run physics 237 with NHit>=25 (Trigger rate 63, file 7.6 
Mbytes/s)
22:25 Change run control to "beginrun.csh" and "endrun.csh" to be 
remote-control friendly.
22:20 Start run physics 254 with NHit>=25 (Trigger rate 63, file 7.6

2017-07-31
 8:30 Inner vessel level 15.8 cm consistent with yesterday. No obvious 
level change.
     Outer vessel level 20.45 cm consistent with early measurement.
 Stop run 254
   Run 255 is strange. May be a hung-up run restarted

The ultrasonic detectors are connected all the time. The power line and USB are 
still connected. The measure software is closed. I am not sure whether they are

The ultrasonic detectors connect with inner sphere or outer sphere alternately 
day by day. In other words, inner sphere is connected one day and the outer 
sphere is connected the next day.
